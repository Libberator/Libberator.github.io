# Oh, hello there

I'm a gamedev hobbyist and a moderator for a Unity/programming Discord channel with over 3k members.

My prior work was in Logistics, my education was Electrical Engineering, but my passion is in programming and problem-solving.

I hope to share some of the things I've learned here, or be able to use this site as a reference for frequently asked questions or recurring topics.

I also go by Libbs
